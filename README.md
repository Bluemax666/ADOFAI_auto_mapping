# ADOFAI_auto_mapping
Its a python script that can record your key presses when listening to the music and then creates the map automatically

by default the key to press is set to 'e' and the key to exit is 'q' when you launch the script once you press 'e' it will start the music and then you can press the key to rythm you want and then press the exit key, after that it will wait 6 seconds so you can go in the editor and select the second starting tile and it will press automatically the keyboard keys to create the corresponding chart
